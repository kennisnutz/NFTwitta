1./ after connecting with metamask, app doesnt desplay home page, instead it gets stuck on the loading 
UI.


Fix:
error was due to incorrect syntax in .env.local file where the api_token was not assigned properly


2./ Sanity data base not displaying author value in "author" field

Fix:
changed miss-matched variable name for currentAccountId in NFTTwittaContext.js and currentAccount in TweetBox.js
