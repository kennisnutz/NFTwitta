1./ after connecting with metamask, app doesnt desplay home page, instead it gets stuck on the loading 
UI.


Fix:
error was due to incorrect syntax in .env.local file where the api_token was not assigned properly

Fix:
changed miss-matched variable name for currentAccountId in NFTTwittaContext.js and currentAccount in TweetBox.js

attribute from  the code block on line 117 of NFTTwittaContext.js file is undefined: (TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'profileImage'))
Fix: deleted the erroneous content from database
